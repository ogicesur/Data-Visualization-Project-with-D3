# InfoViz Team 18 

## About the project
Our visualization shows the number of [arrivals and overnight stays of tourists in the 16 federal states of Germany](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?operation=previous&levelindex=3&step=1&titel=Statistik+%28Tabellen%29&levelid=1673974672059&levelid=1673974365906#astructure) from 2019 to 2021.
We found out that the number of guests is bigger in the summer months and that Bavaria is the most popular destination for tourists.
